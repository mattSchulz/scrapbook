#Matt's scrapbook: a miscellaneous collection of odds and ends.
##Pixel strobe
- A tiny color strobe which may or may not help if you have an LCD with a stuck pixel.
- Set a refresh time and then select the button that matches your problem pixel. Position the flashing box over the effected area.

###disclaimers
- I'm a layperson regarding screen tech but I think this should work faster than [JScreenFix](http://jscreenfix.com). Instead of trying to get the problem pixel to jump around randomly, this page focusses all efforts on just getting your problematic subpixel to switch on and off, over and over.
- Just like surgery, there's a chance this could make things worse. Use at your own risk.
