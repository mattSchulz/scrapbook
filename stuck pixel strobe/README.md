#Matt's scrapbook: a miscellaneous collection of odds and ends.
##Pixel strobe
*A tiny html canvas which may or may not help if you have an LCD with a stuck pixel.
*Press the button that matches your problem pixel and position the flashing box over the effected area.

###disclaimers
*I'm a layman when it comes to screen technology but by my logic this should work faster than [JScreenFix](http://jscreenfix.com). Instead of trying to get the problem pixel to jump around randomly, this page focusses all efforts on getting a particular subpixel to go fully off and on, over and over.
*Just like surgery, there's a chance this could make things worse. Use at your own risk.
